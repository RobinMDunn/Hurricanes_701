\caption{Average time (in seconds) it takes to fit one Prediction Band with 350 simulated curves, \(\pm\) 1 standard deviation. Based on simulated curves created with either Autoregressive (AR) or Non-Autoregressive (AR) models for changes in bearing and speed and with either a Kernel-based lysis model (Kernel) or Logistic-based lysis models (Logistic).}
